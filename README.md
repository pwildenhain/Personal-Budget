# payday-budget

## Inspiration

I built this budget tool to track finances the way **I** want. All other tools don't meet my needs such as:

* Budgeting per payday cycle
* Rolling balances that _accumulate_, not reset when a new cycle begins
* Transfering balance surplus between accounts
* Adding comments to my transactions, for future reference

Futhermore, this gives me a chance to build my python programming skills. Woot woot!

## Scripts

1. `create_budget.py`: Build a budget, one account at a time
2. `update_budget.py`
    * Add Transactions
    * Modify the budget (add accounts, update budgeted amounts, etc)
    * Record a payday to replenish the budget
