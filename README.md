# payday-budget

## Inspiration

I built this budget tool to track finances the way **I** want. All other tools don't meet my needs such as:

* Budgeting per payday cycle
* Rolling balances that _accumulate_, not reset when a new cycle begins
* Transfering balance surplus between accounts
* Adding comments to my transactions, for future reference

Futhermore, this gives me a chance to build my python programming skills. Woot woot!
